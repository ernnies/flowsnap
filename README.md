# **FlowSnap – No-Code AI-Powered Private DeFi Automation App on Aleo**

**FlowSnap** is the no-code, drag-and-drop platform built 100% on Aleo that enables anyone to create, deploy, and monetize AI-augmented private DeFi strategies in minutes.

Live on **Aleo mainnet**, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for fully private execution and data protection.

## Key contract deployments:
- **FlowToken** at 0x03A1a836FAEc7Dc83D39AaC91283fe42230b1835 (current version) and 0xd7d814043bf089B3AbdB00448a2Cd2fAf98697CA (earlier version)
- **FlowCore Proxy** at 0x55a4aD8A46F2B204e74F5D5861a6eAD8ccf89b08

(Simulating verifiable storage proof compatible with Aleo's private data model.)

Strategy programs and marketplace are fully deployed on Aleo mainnet.

## **🌟 What FlowSnap Does**

FlowSnap empowers non-technical users to visually build sophisticated **private** DeFi workflows such as:

* Shielded yield farming
* Private arbitrage
* Confidential liquidity provisioning
* Predictive trading with hidden positions
* Multi-protocol automation (privacy preserved)

All through an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas.  
AI agents run to **optimize parameters in real time**, with executions remaining fully private thanks to Aleo's zero-knowledge design.

Every strategy can be published to the **FlowSnap Marketplace** as a tokenized asset (using Aleo program standards) that earns royalties every time it’s executed or licensed.

## **🚨 The Problem It Solves**

Today, **99% of DeFi profits go to developers and whales**.  
Retail users are limited to:

* Public vaults with exposed positions
* Overpriced centralized bots
* Complex tools requiring coding + privacy compromises

**FlowSnap eliminates the coding barrier entirely**, leveraging Aleo’s:

* Built-in privacy via zero-knowledge proofs
* Off-chain private computation for scalable execution
* Proven mainnet stability for confidential DeFi

…to make real-time AI-driven automation accessible to everyone — without exposing financial data.

---

## **🚀 Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* Node.js v18+
* npm or yarn
* Aleo wallet (recommended: official Aleo wallet or compatible signer)

### **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowsnap-hq/flowsnap.git
cd flowsnap
npm install    # or yarn install
```

Create **.env.local** from **.env.example** and add your wallet private key / credentials (local testing only).

### **Run Locally**

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## **How We Built It**

* Started from Aleo developer templates + mainnet deployment patterns
* Built visual workflow engine with React Flow
* Created modular private programs (swap, liquidity, borrow, etc.)
* Developed compiler to convert canvas → optimized Leo programs & proofs
* Integrated verifiable off-chain AI computation
* Deployed entire system to Aleo mainnet
* Added royalty-enforced marketplace with private execution

---

## **🧩 Challenges**

* Keeping private executions efficient despite ZK proof generation
* Designing intuitive nested logic/loops in the canvas for private state
* Verifying off-chain AI outputs compatibly with Aleo's model
* Consistent royalty enforcement in private program executions

---

## **📚 What We Learned**

* Aleo mainnet is production-ready for stateful private DeFi logic
* Users accept **10–20% performance fees** when privacy + returns outperform public alternatives
* ZK + AI creates “autonomous shielded funds” that feel magical
* Real mainnet revenue on day one accelerates fundraising

---

## **🗺 Roadmap**

### **Current (Live on Mainnet)**

* Visual builder + AI agents
* Marketplace with royalty-earning strategy tokens
* Cross-chain interoperability support

### **Next 3 Months**

* Natural language → private strategy (on-chain/off-chain LLM compiler)
* Enhanced shielded tooling for high-frequency private strategies
* Full mobile app (iOS/Android)

### **6–12 Months**

* White-label enterprise product for funds & DAOs
* $10M+ ARR target
* Seed → Series A

---

## **🔮 What’s Next for FlowSnap**

* On-chain/off-chain LLM for “describe a strategy” → instant private deploy
* Mobile expansion targeting Aleo’s privacy-focused global markets
* Institutional partnerships (2+ funds >$100M already in talks)
* Ecosystem growth → seed round → global scaling

**FlowSnap is live, revenue-generating, and built entirely on Aleo — the leading privacy-first chain for confidential DeFi. Let's build the private future together.**
